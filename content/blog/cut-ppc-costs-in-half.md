Are you spending thousands on Google Ads with disappointing results? You're not alone. Most businesses waste 40-60% of their PPC budget on poorly optimized campaigns.

Here are 5 proven strategies to cut your costs while improving performance:

## 1. Master Negative Keywords

The fastest way to stop wasting money is adding negative keywords. These tell Google what NOT to show your ads for.

**Action Steps:**
- Review your search terms report weekly
- Add irrelevant terms as negatives
- Use broad match negatives for entire categories
- Build a master negative keyword list

**Result:** Typically saves 20-30% of budget immediately.

## 2. Improve Your Quality Score

Higher Quality Scores = Lower costs per click. Google rewards relevant ads with cheaper clicks.

**Focus on:**
- Ad relevance to keywords
- Landing page experience
- Expected click-through rate

**Pro Tip:** A Quality Score increase from 5 to 8 can reduce your CPC by 40%.

## 3. Use Geo-Targeting Wisely

Stop advertising everywhere. Focus on locations that actually convert.

**Implementation:**
- Check conversion rates by location
- Exclude non-converting areas
- Bid higher in profitable locations
- Use radius targeting for local businesses

## 4. Schedule Your Ads Strategically

Not all hours are equal. Find when your customers actually buy.

**How to optimize:**
- Review performance by hour and day
- Pause ads during low-conversion times
- Increase bids during peak hours
- Test different schedules

**Example:** One client saved $2,000/month by pausing ads from 11 PM - 6 AM.

## 5. Perfect Your Landing Pages

Your ads might be great, but if your landing page converts at 1%, you're burning money.

**Quick wins:**
- Match landing page to ad message
- Clear, single call-to-action
- Remove navigation (keep them focused)
- Add trust signals (reviews, guarantees)
- Mobile optimization

**Impact:** Improving conversion rate from 2% to 4% cuts your cost per lead in half.
