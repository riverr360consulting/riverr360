# Email Marketing That Actually Converts

Email marketing has an average ROI of $42 for every $1 spent. But only if you do it right.

## Why Most Email Marketing Fails

Three common mistakes:
1. **Boring subject lines** - Nobody opens
2. **No clear offer** - People don't know what to do
3. **Selling too hard** - Subscribers hit unsubscribe

## The Simple Framework That Works

### Step 1: Write Subject Lines People Actually Open

**Bad:** "Newsletter #47"  
**Good:** "Quick question about your marketing"

**Bad:** "Our latest blog post"  
**Good:** "This mistake is costing you $10K/month"

**Tips:**
- Ask questions
- Create curiosity
- Promise a benefit
- Keep it under 50 characters

### Step 2: Start With Value, Not Sales

Your first few emails should GIVE, not ASK.

**Example sequence:**
- Email 1: Helpful tip
- Email 2: Case study
- Email 3: Free resource
- Email 4: Soft offer
- Email 5: Direct ask

Build trust first, sell second.

### Step 3: One Email, One Goal

Don't confuse people with multiple links and CTAs.

**Each email should have:**
- One main idea
- One call-to-action
- One link (or multiple to same place)

### Step 4: Make It Personal

Write like you're talking to a friend:
- Use "you" and "I"
- Tell stories
- Share failures
- Be human

**Not this:** "Our company announces..."  
**But this:** "I learned something interesting yesterday..."

## Email Types That Perform Best

### Welcome Series
New subscriber? Send 3-5 emails over the first week introducing yourself and delivering value.

### Newsletter
Weekly or bi-weekly updates with tips, insights, and occasional offers.

### Promotional
Special offers, launches, limited-time deals. Use sparingly (80% value, 20% promotion).

### Re-engagement
Haven't opened in 60 days? Send a "miss you" email with your best content.

## Automation That Works

Set up these automated sequences:

1. **Welcome sequence** - Triggers when someone subscribes
2. **Abandoned cart** - For e-commerce (if applicable)
3. **Post-purchase** - Thank you + upsell
4. **Re-engagement** - Win back inactive subscribers

## Metrics to Track

Ignore vanity metrics. Focus on:

- **Open rate:** 20-30% is good
- **Click rate:** 2-5% is solid
- **Conversion rate:** Depends on offer
- **Unsubscribe rate:** Under 0.5% is healthy

## The #1 Email Marketing Rule

**Consistency beats perfection.**

A simple email sent every week beats a "perfect" email sent once a month.
